# automatically in sync, use consumer-workflow-minimal.yml instead:

#
# FORK PR SECURITY:
# - Repository secrets are unavailable to fork PRs
# - The GITHUB_TOKEN is read-only for fork PRs
# - This workflow gates full review to same-repo PRs only
# - Fork PRs trigger the workflow but skip review jobs
