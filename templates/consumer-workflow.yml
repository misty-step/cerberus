# Cerberus AI Code Review Council

#
# FORK PR SECURITY NOTE:
# - GitHub Actions running on fork PRs have NO access to repository secrets
# - The GITHUB_TOKEN is read-only for fork PRs
# - This workflow explicitly gates full review to same-repo PRs only
# - Fork PRs will trigger this workflow but skip the review jobs
# - This prevents confusing failures from secret-dependent operations
#
# Fork PR Detection:
# - github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork == true  → PR from a fork
# - github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository → same repo
