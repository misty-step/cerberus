# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: This template hardcodes the reviewer matrix and will drift
# from the Cerberus roster over time. For a minimal workflow that stays
# automatically in sync, use consumer-workflow-minimal.yml instead:

# FORK PR SECURITY:
# - Repository secrets are unavailable to fork PRs
# - The GITHUB_TOKEN is read-only for fork PRs
# - This workflow gates full review to same-repo PRs only
# - Fork PRs trigger the workflow but skip review jobs
