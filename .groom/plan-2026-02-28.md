# Grooming Plan — 2026-02-28

## Session Goal
Tighten backlog so every issue is autopilot/flywheel-ready.

## Actions Taken

### Labels + Milestones Applied
All 28 open issues now have: priority, type, horizon, effort, source, domain, milestone, and GitHub issue type.

| Milestone | Issues |
|-----------|--------|
| PRIMARY 1: OSS Production Readiness | #305, #302, #300, #299, #298, #297, #296, #295, #293, #290, #283, #282, #278, #276, #275, #273, #264, #258, #257, #256, #239 |
| PRIMARY 2: OSS Chargeability Hardening | #288, #287, #284, #267, #266, #260 |
| DEFERRED: Research / Expansion | #291, #261, #57, #21, #126 |

### Body Enrichments Applied
Issues with sparse bodies enriched to agent-executable standard (ACs, affected files, verification, approach, diagram):
- #282: Timeout misreported as API_KEY_INVALID
- #283: Model pool cleanup (remove minimax-m2.5, mimo-v2-flash)
- #284: Draft comment cleanup + verdict repositioning
- #290: Verdict fails on network timeout
- #296: parse-review.py no retry on empty LLM response
- #288: Capability policy documentation
- #287: Extract orchestration state machine
- #273: CLI test coverage + package name hardening
- #300: Dead code/unused deps severity promotion
- #302: Mutable @master + secret = minor/major
- #298: Error propagation chain tracing
- #297: Control-flow and sentinel error tracing
- #295: Cross-file correctness gaps (Dockerfile PRs)

### project.md Created
Migrated from vision.md with full sections: Vision, Domain Glossary, Active Focus, Quality Bar, Patterns to Follow, Lessons Learned.

### vision.md Removed
Replaced by project.md.

## Current Sprint (now horizon)
- #305 [p0] Stop demoting real issues to info — [unverified] suppresses legitimate findings
- #293 [p1] Testing perspective: unknown error class skips retries
- #278 [p1] Timeout partial outputs misclassified as parse failures
- #256 [p2] Remove phantom perspectives from action.yml

## Recommended Execution Order

### P0 First
1. #305 — Fix [unverified] severity demotion (parse-review.py) — blocks trust in all verdicts

### P1 Reliability
2. #293 — Fix unknown error class skips retries (runtime_facade.py)
3. #278 — Fix timeout partial outputs misclassified as parse failures
4. #290 — Fix verdict fails on network timeout (verdict/action.yml)
5. #296 — Add retry for empty LLM response in parse-review.py
6. #282 — Fix timeout misreported as API_KEY_INVALID

### P1 Review Quality (prompt improvements)
7. #302 — Guard: mutable @master + secret = minor/major
8. #298 — Trace: error propagation chain tracing
9. #297 — Trace: control-flow and sentinel error tracing
10. #295 — Cross-file correctness for Dockerfile PRs

### P2 Cleanup
11. #256 — Remove phantom perspectives
12. #283 — Remove unreliable models from pool (config-only)
13. #257 — Extract magic numbers to constants
14. #260 — Rename consumer-workflow-minimal.yml

## Deferred
- #291: Incremental review awareness (effort/xl, major feature, defer to v3.x)
- #261: Auto-detect consumer package manager (nice-to-have, low priority)

## Research Findings
- Agent prompts live in `.opencode/agents/` under descriptive names (correctness.md, security.md, etc.), NOT codenames (trace, guard, etc.)
- `bin/cerberus.js` is the CLI scaffolder entry point
- Severity promotion logic is absent from both parse-review.py and aggregate-verdict.py — only downgrade paths exist
- Issue type IDs from org-standards work correctly for misty-step/cerberus repo
