# Coverage ratchet policy
# To advance the ratchet: bump global_floor to the next step, then push.
# Do NOT lower any value — floors are load-bearing quality gates.
#
# See docs/coverage-policy.md for rationale and advancement procedure.

global_floor: 80      # Currently active floor (line AND branch coverage)
patch_threshold: 90   # New/changed lines must be >= this % covered on PRs

# Ratchet history — ascending archive of completed steps.
# global_floor must always be one of these values.
ratchet_steps: [30, 45, 60, 70, 80]
# 30 ✓ initial
# 45 ✓ completed
# 60 ✓ completed
# 70 ✓ completed
