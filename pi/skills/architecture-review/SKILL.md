# Architecture Focus

Prioritize structural impacts:
- boundary leaks and dependency-direction violations
- shallow abstractions and cross-layer coupling
- API surface inflation and contract instability
- configuration ownership and override clarity

Flag only architecture findings with clear long-term impact.
