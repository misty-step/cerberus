# Vision

## One-Liner
Multi-agent AI code review council that gates PRs with specialized, parallel reviewers.

## North Star
A published GitHub Action that any team can install, configure reviewer perspectives, choose their LLM backend, and get high-signal code reviews on every PR.

## Key Differentiators
- Multiple specialized perspectives vs single-pass review
- Council verdict with override protocol vs binary pass/fail
- Model-agnostic architecture (Kimi, Claude, GPT, Gemini)
- Zero-config sensible defaults, deep config when needed

## Target User
Engineering teams (2-50 devs) who want automated code review that catches what humans miss, without drowning in noise.

## Current Focus
1. Harden MVP: tests, error handling, CI reliability
2. Improve review quality: reduce noise, increase signal
3. Package as reusable GitHub Action
4. Multi-model provider support
